# ðŸ“˜ GTx: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java I

Welcome to my course repository for **GTx: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java I â€“ Foundations and Syntax Basics**, offered by Georgia Tech on edX.

This repo tracks my progress, notes, and code exercises as I build foundational Java skills and explore the basics of object-oriented programming.

## ðŸ§  Course Overview

This course introduces the **Java programming language** with a focus on:

- Java syntax and structure
- Object-oriented thinking (classes and objects)
- Console input/output
- Control flow (if, switch, loops)
- Arrays and basic data handling
- Modularity with methods

## âœ… What Iâ€™m Learning

- The history and motivation behind Java and OOP
- Creating and executing basic Java programs
- Using whitespace, comments, and debugging tools
- Declaring variables and expressions
- Creating and using objects of built-in classes (like `String`)
- Terminal input/output and string formatting
- Writing control flow logic with `if`, `if-else`, `switch`
- Implementing loops using `while`, `do-while`, and `for`
- Working with one- and two-dimensional arrays
- Writing static methods and method overloading
